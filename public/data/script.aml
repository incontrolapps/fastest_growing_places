headline:Fastest growing places
lede:The number of people of different ages living in in different parts of England and Wales is in constant flux. In these first results from the 2011 Census, we look at which places have grown or shrunk, where the population is ageing and how areas compare.
nutgraf:Censuses are ten-year snapshots. The 2021 Census was carried out in March 2021, during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Other events, like the continued effect of the 2008 financial crash, the 2012 Olympics and Brexit may also have influenced where we live compared to ten years ago.

content:Tracking the change in population size of a cohort, for example women born in 1974, allows us a glimpse of how many new arrivals or departures an area has seen, over and above the ususal coming and going of the population. For example, we typically see drops in the number of 20-somethings in towns with fewer further eduction facilities, as young adults move away from home to study. Other Census data provides a more in-depth understanding of which people have moved.
